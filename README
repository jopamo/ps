Skeleton multiple processes

DESCRIPTION:
This is the warm-up project building on previous Linux course knowledge.
We produce two executables, oss and user.

REQUIREMENTS (UP TO DAY 3):
- Makefile that compiles both executables at the same time (all target).
- oss parses command line with getopt(-h, -n, -s, -t) but does not fork yet.
- user prints PID and PPID in a loop, sleeping 1 second.

COMPILATION:
From the ps/ directory, run:
  make

USAGE:
1) ./p1/oss -h
2) ./p1/oss -n <proc> -s <simul> -t <iter>
3) ./p1/user <iterations>   (test only, as user is not normally run directly)

CLEAN:
make clean

VERSION CONTROL:
We use git. The repository includes all source and this README.
